# BetterPicker

A mod that improves the editor color picker.

Restructures it to a saturation & value/lightness square and hue slider, alongside HSV/HSL text inputs.

Supported color spaces:

-   HSV
-   HSL
-   OkHSV
-   OkHSL

Color conversion functions adapted to C++ from [Bjorn Ottosson](https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker/)
